This will log traces to the default project (though you can easily change that).\\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=trueexport LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your-api-key>export LANGSMITH_PROJECT=default\\nnoteYou may see these variables referenced as LANGCHAIN_* in other places. These are all equivalent, however the best practice is to use LANGSMITH_TRACING, LANGSMITH_API_KEY, LANGSMITH_PROJECT.The LANGSMITH_PROJECT flag is only supported in JS SDK versions >= 0.2.16, use LANGCHAIN_PROJECT instead if you are using an older version.\\nTrace your LLM calls\\u200b\\nThe first thing you might want to trace is all your OpenAI calls.\\nAfter all, this is where the LLM is actually being called, so it is the most important part!\\nWe\\'ve tried to make this as easy as possible with LangSmith by introducing a dead-simple OpenAI wrapper.\\nAll you have to do is modify your code to look something like:\\nPythonTypeScriptfrom openai import OpenAIfrom langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openaiopenai_client = wrap_openai(OpenAI())# This is the retriever we will use in RAG# This is mocked out, but it could be anything we wantdef retriever(query: str):    results = [\"Harrison worked at Kensho\"]    return results# This is the end-to-end RAG chain.# It does a retrieval step then calls OpenAIdef rag(question):    docs = retriever(question)    system_message = \"\"\"Answer the users question using only the provided information below:        {docs}\"\"\".format(docs=\"\\\\n\".join(docs))        return openai_client.chat.completions.create(        messages=[            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_message},            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": question},        ],        model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",    )import { OpenAI } from \"openai\";import { wrapOpenAI } from \"langsmith/wrappers\";const openAIClient = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI());// This is the retriever we will use in RAG// This is mocked out, but it could be anything we wantasync function retriever(query: string) {  return [\"This is a document\"];}// This is the end-to-end RAG chain.// It does a retrieval step then calls OpenAIasync function rag(question: string) {  const docs = await retriever(question);    const systemMessage =    \"Answer the users question using only the provided information below:\\\\n\\\\n\" +    docs.join(\"\\\\n\");      return await openAIClient.chat.completions.create({    messages: [      { role: \"system\", content: systemMessage },      { role: \"user\", content: question },    ],    model: \"gpt-4o-mini\",  });}\\nNotice how we import from langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai and use it to wrap the OpenAI client (openai_client = wrap_openai(OpenAI())).\\nWhat happens if you call it in the following way?\\nrag(\"where did harrison work\")\\nThis will produce a trace of just the OpenAI call - it should look something like this\\n\\nTrace the whole chain\\u200b\\nGreat - we\\'ve traced the LLM call.

So you don\\'t really want to be stuck looking at datapoints one at a time.\\nLuckily, LangSmith has a set of tools to help with observability in production.\\nMonitoring\\u200b\\nIf you click on the Monitor tab in a project, you will see a series of monitoring charts.\\nHere we track lots of LLM specific statistics - number of traces, feedback, time-to-first-token, etc.\\nYou can view these over time across a few different time bins.\\n\\nA/B Testing\\u200b\\nnoteGroup-by functionality for A/B testing requires at least 2 different values to exist for a given metadata key.\\nYou can also use this tab to perform a version of A/B Testing.\\nIn the previous tutorial we starting tracking a few different metadata attributes - one of which was llm.\\nWe can group the monitoring charts by ANY metadata attribute, and instantly get grouped charts over time.\\nThis allows us to experiment with different LLMs (or prompts, or other) and track their performance over time.\\nIn order to do this, we just need to click on the Metadata button at the top.\\nThis will give us a drop down of options to choose from to group by:\\n\\nOnce we select this, we will start to see charts grouped by this attribute:\\n\\nDrilldown\\u200b\\nOne of the awesome abilities that LangSmith provides is the ability to easily drilldown into datapoints that you identify\\nas problematic while looking at monitoring charts.\\nIn order to do this, you can simply hover over a datapoint in the monitoring chart.\\nWhen you do this, you will be able to click the datapoint.\\nThis will lead you back to the runs table with a filtered view:\\n\\nConclusion\\u200b\\nIn this tutorial you saw how to set up your LLM application with best-in-class observability.\\nNo matter what stage your application is in, you will still benefit from observability.\\nIf you have more in-depth questions about observability, check out the how-to section for guides on topics like testing, prompt management, and more.Was this page helpful?You can leave detailed feedback on GitHub.PreviousObservability tutorialsNextObservability how-to guidesPrototypingSet up your environmentTrace your LLM callsTrace the whole chainTrace the retrieval stepBeta TestingCollecting FeedbackLogging MetadataProductionMonitoringA/B TestingDrilldownConclusionCommunityLangChain ForumTwitterGitHubDocs CodeLangSmith SDKPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogLangChain Python DocsLangChain JS/TS DocsCopyright ¬© 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n')]"
